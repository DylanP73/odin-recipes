    <p>You only need 4 ingredients for the Flour Tortillas and they will make all my other Mexican dishes come together.</p>
    <p>Personally I just call them 'The Breads' and use them with Indian meals we have too.</p>
    <p>This recipe is for flour tortillas, but you can make Corn Tortillas too.</p>
    <p>I usually make 20+ for about 6 people, but these ingredients will be enough to make 10 Tortillas (You can of course adjust as you need)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Plain or All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 Heaped teaspoon of fine salt</li>
            <li>150ml Warm Water</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons oil (Ideally not a a flavoured oil)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the flour to a large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Poke a dip in the middle and add the oil</li>
            <li>Give the flour a bit of stir to move the oil around</li>
            <li>Dissolve the salt in to the warm water and add to the mixing bowl</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>It's time to get your hands in and mix now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep pushing the flour against the side of the bowl and continually fold the flour back on itself
                <ul>
                    <li>Eventually everything binds together and your bowl and fingers will be clean again</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Toss a little flour on to a clean work surface and keep kneading and folding the dough for a a few more minutes</li>
            <li>When you feel like you have created a nice big ball of dough, roll out out with your hands a little to create a longer more even even roll (A bit like a Swiss roll size)</li>
            <li>You can now cut the dough in to 10 or so even amounts (They don't need to be exact and you don't need to weigh them)</li>
            <li>You can now roll the dough out with a a rolling pin (Just add a little flour to the work surface and the rolling pin to stop everything sticking)
                <ul>
                    <li>I am not too bothered about the shapes, but anything representing round or oblong shapes will be fine (Sometimes mine look like a starfish, but they all taste the same)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you have made a tortilla, you can place on a piece of grease proof paper and stack up on top of each other with paper in between (Or if you finished up with quite floury tortillas they would be fine on top of each other.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I use an old frying pan. Something I keep in the back of the cupboard for making these breads. It's a little burnt and charred now, and you would never be able to fry an egg with it, but it's great for cooking the tortillas.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the pan fairly hot without any oil</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, add a tortillas and cook for about 30 seconds (They will burn and charcoal, but this is so much better for the flavour)</li>
            <li>After about 30 seconds, flip the tortilla over and do the same on the other side</li>
            <li>The tortilla will create some large bubbles, some I pop some I just watch</li>
            <li>You will get a few of these wrong and overcook them, it always happens but they are still fine to eat</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>As you cook them you can either add them to a clean tea towel and put them aside ready to eat. I personally wrap a stack of them in plenty of tin foil and place in the oven to keep them warm (This also keeps them soft).</p>
    <p>Just a side note: Serve the tortillas warm (You can heat them back up if needed). Cold tortillas will break, warm tortillas will wrap around your food like you want them to do.</p>

    <h2>Serving</h2>
    <p>We usually add 2 or 3 stacks of Tortillas in tin foil on the table, and tear them open to use.</p>
    <p>You can now make you tacos with the other Mexican recipes below</p>
