    <p>Make this last, when you are close to eating.</p>
    <p>Avocados don't last too long when they are exposed. If you were to make this the day before, it would be brown and probably not a good idea any more.</p>
    <p>For freshness (And entertainment I guess), Guacamole is usually made at the table for you in many Mexican restaurants. Some people seem to think it's unnecessary but I personally love it (And you get to see how fresh the avocados are too).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This recipe makes a good heaped bowl.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Avocados (Soft not too mushy)</li>
            <li>2 Garlic Cloves (Chopped really fine)</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>Half a Lemon (Juiced)</li>
            <li>Half a Lemon (Juiced)</li>
            <li>A couple of dashes of Hot Sauce (Optional)</li>
            <li>Just under half a cup of the <a href="../recipes/pico-de-gallo.html">Pico De Gallo</a></li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Really simple. just chop up the avocado into small pieces, add all the ingredients and the Pico De Gallo. Mush everything together and add to a serving bowl.</p>
