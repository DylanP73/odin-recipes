    <p>No words can do this <strong>Pico De Gallo justice</strong>, if you follow these instructions, you will hopefully have the same experience and taste sensation as I did.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This Pico De Gallo is also used as one of the ingredients in my <a href="../recipes/guacamole.html">Guacamole</a></li>
        </ul>

    <p>It's simple to make and it gets involved with many of the Mexican recipes linked at the bottom of this page.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Mexican Dishes below, this Pico De Gallo will blow away any jar of salsa you can buy for your chips and dips movie night. It's not salsa, but it does have similarities.</p>
    <p>These ingredients will make a decent cereal sized bowl. I would generally make 3 or 4 times the amount just by multiplying the amounts below for how much I need (Remember movie night too).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tomatoes (I use good strong vine tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1 Red Onion</li>
            <li>1 Small Jalapeño Pepper</li>
            <li>Half a cup (a Good handful) of Fresh Coriander
                <ul>
                    <li>(Cilantro if you are American)</li>
                </ul>    
            </li>
            <li>1 Lemon (Juiced)
                <ul>
                    <li>(I hold back ever so slightly on using a full lemon)</li>
                </ul>    
            </li>
            <li>Half a Lime (Juiced)</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Dry Oregano</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Chilli Powder</li>
            <li>Half a Teaspoon Cumin</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>My personal tip: Don't substitute any of the fresh ingredients on this one. The dish will taste so clean and fresh that it would be a shame to swap out the jalapeños for a pickled jar of jalapeños for instance (I have tried, and it's not the same).</p>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>The instructions for this are simple. Chop everything really fine! It will take a bit of effort to intricately cut everything up, but this is an important part of the process. Chunky onions will make it taste 'oniony', and that just takes away how the ingredients work together.</p>
    <p>Add everything to a bowl, mix it together and cover. This will now last in the fridge for days (I would usually make this on the morning of the day I need it).</p>
