    <p>Ideally you need to marinade for at least 4 hours (overnight will be so much better).</p>
    <p>First thing to do is choose the right cut of meat.</p>
    <p>I have tried more expensive steaks, but it's just not necessary for this meal. The best cut is a cheap thin cut of Flank Steak, Frying Steak, Skirt Steak or just simply thin cut beef. I believe many of us have our own word for it.</p>
    <p>I would use about 1.5kg (If there are 6 or so people eating).</p>
    <p>Chop up the meat into small strips about 7cm by 1.5cm (or there about)</p>
    <p>Add to a marinade bag or bowl with:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a cup (a Good handful) of Fresh Coriander very finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>Quarter of a cup of Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Orange (Juiced)</li>
            <li>1 Lime (Juiced)</li>
            <li>4 Cloves of Garlic (Minced or Finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 Small Jalape√±o Pepper (Finely Chopped)</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Ground Cumin</li>
            <li>A good pinch of Salt and Pepper (I go for a full teaspoon)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <p>Add everything together with the thinly cut steak - Simply toss it, mix it or shake it in a bag.</p>
    <p>Place it in the fridge until you are ready to cook it (Ideally for the next day)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I do like to visit the fridge and flip it the other way quite a lot</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Methods</h2>
    
    <p>I cook in either a wok in the kitchen or a Skillet on my BBQ (I find the wok easier as you can use the sides for everything to tumble around).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can now cook this to your liking, personally I like it just about done like a medium rare. It's also great if you overdo it a little with the burnt ends</li>
            <li>Leave it to rest a few minutes and lightly chop in to it with a knife on a chopping board to create smaller more shredded chunks.
                <ul>
                    <li>(This isn't essential, it just stops people taking so much when they scoop it out for their tacos).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>    
        
    <h2>Serving</h2>

    <p>Add to a serving bowl and drop in a large spoon or kitchen tongs for everyone to serve themselves.</p>
    <p>This now accompanies everything else you will have created for your Mexican meal</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../recipes/flour-tortillas.html">Flour Tortillas</a></li>
            <li><a href="../recipes/guacamole.html">Guacamole</a></li>
            <li><a href="../recipes/pico-de-gallo.html">Pico De Gallo</a></li>
        </ul>

    <p>Play around with it and make it your own: I often change this one up a little with a big dollop of honey, sticky teriyaki sauce or whatever takes my fancy at the time.</p>
    <p>.Sometimes, I have just cooked the meat on the BBQ as one whole marinated piece and chopped it up later. Although this works a bit better when you are actually having a BBQ rather than a few guests over in the dining room.</p>
